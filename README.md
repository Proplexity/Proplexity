** Developer **

I am an Indie developer currently in college going for my CS major. I  have been on my programming jouirney for roughly 4 years and 
have only recently within the last 2 or so years gotten into game developement. As Game Dev has become such a strong passion of mine 
I hope to make it a more permanent part of my life and find wrk with it.
